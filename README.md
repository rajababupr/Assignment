# Assignment 1
To develop a simple rule engine application in Java 8 that utilizes an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for evaluating user eligibility based on various attributes, we need to break down the task into the following components:

1.Data Structure: Define the Node class representing the AST.
2.API Design: Implement methods to create rules, combine rules, and evaluate rules.
3.Data Storage: Choose a database (like SQLite or H2) for storing rules.
4.Test Cases: Implement test cases for verifying the functionality.
